"Buy from them if you want to ruin your special occasion. They delivered the product way too late and that too a wrong one. Worst customer service(if at all it exists) I’ve experienced."
"Guys before buying from them please read the comments on their posts and also check their google reviews almost all are 1 star. Save yourself from frustration they are not worth even a penny. There are better options out there dont spoil your special days. Not just me, there are many frustrated customers go and check the comments and reviews.🙏🏻🙏🏻"
"Its a fraud site dont order"
"I want to call out the extremely disappointing service from your end. Order a personalised rose plant last week and it was supposed to arrive last week. It still hasn't arrived. When I track order it still says In transit. This has been the status for the last 3 days. Order number is 6155640. This is realy bad."
"I ordered a pinata cake from this site"
"In images it showed under spider face a small cake."
"When i received the cake and it was opened with the hammer there were some oreo biscuits and dairy milk 10 rs chocolate and no cake"
"I was embarassed.I contacted them and showed them proof."
"They said after 3-4 days we will raise your issue"
"I asked for refund, they said we will refund half of your money."
"The next day i asked them again then they said return us cake then we will refund"
"Now tell me who will keep that cake"
"Now they said we will return only 20 percent"
"This is a fraud site"
"Never order from here"
"Fraud company"

"@bookthesurprise I wish you run out of business soon for spoiling so many people’s special occasion.
"Rob from so many people and give gifts to others. @bookthesurprise you bunch of low life cheaps you destroyed my occasion and are also not ready to compensate. Delivered the product too late and that too the wrong and are offering just 200rs refund for a 900rs product. Bloody bastards"

"Odered at 11 am till now not recieved any. Even after mailing you. Pathetic service. Whole day got ruined. Doing such things will not help you ahead."
"Kindly initiate my refund or I am going to consumer court! Check your emails and whatapp.. there is no one to reply. Such a shame that you scam people like this @bookthesurprise"
"@bookthesurprise pathetic experience it was... Customer service number always busy. No chat support.... I have placed my order at 11th Feb. But still now it was not delivered.... Please update... My order I'd 6053577"
"@bookthesurprise the worst service ever possible! Ordered flowers in morning and not delivered. Then no one picks the phone or replies mail. Worst experience of ordering"
"@bookthesurprise Worst service and a very bad user experience...no time value and very bad customer experience"
"@bookthesurprise You shouldn't advertise or accept orders when you cannot fulfill the order. I placed an order (ID-6133037) in the morning which has not yet been delivered, valentine's day is over as it is!! What is the point? No one is responding over call/chat/mail. Yeah, that's the way to run a business, by running away & letting customers suffer.!!"
"This is such a hopeless site!!! I haven’t yet received my order and got a message saying it delivered.over that there is no customer service available to ask for refund."
"PATHETIC SERVICE AND EQUALLY PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE"
"Such a bad service. Have been following up for my order since yesterday but no update. There phone number doesn’t work. Whatsapp doesn’t work and their Wecare@Bookthesurprise.com email address is unmanned. I was promised a call back within 2 business hrs ans it’s 8hrs now and I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE CALL BACK"
"Pathetic service people, false promises of Delhivery and entire waste of money. Better to choose other brands"
"Worst service. They send a message stating the order is delivered without even delivering it. There is no proper response for the calls and they don't even refund .please don't loose your hard earned money!!"
"My order(#6121892) is not delivered,but I got a message and mail of delivering the same,I don't know what is the issue regarding your delivery guy,i don't want it anymore, just refund my money, hope never order again in future, you guys ruined it.(just like last year you guys did)
"Disgusting service."
"No coordination between workshop and call centre."
"Keeping customers on hold for 15_20 minutes"
"then hanged up the call."
"Come on, why you Amatures are taking so much orders if can't deliver it."
"Feeling Cheated."
"Pathetic service u spoiled my day...I want my money back.... don't ever ever book from here .....I ll drop a good message on LinkedIn to your owner"
"This is by far the worst company, they are scamming people."
"Their phones are off, chat botts don’t respond, despite having not delivered the products they act like everything is on track."
"There is 0 accountability. Whoever is behind this should be taken to consumer court."
"There is no way to contact them, and the status of the order changes from delivered to processing. My order was 6108811"
"Dont buy from them, they are scamsters and will literally rob u and spoil your special moments."

"Bookthesurprise call tagging feedback for agent on your Order #5948900 on 24-Dec-2021 1. Cake You have sent incorrect cake to me. I have ordered Black Forest Pinata cake and you have sent some kids chocolate pinata cake. I had my first anniversary yesterday and this was highly disappointing that first of all you have not delivered the correct cake and then when I tried to reach customer care it was not at all handled well. When I called to customer service they asked me to WhatsApp the picture of cake. I did then there was no response in the WhatsApp. Turn around time is horrible. 2. Candle"
"I have tried multiple times to make it light. I never worked."
"Only roses were perfect. The other 2 items could have been responded well and corrected then and there itself. Very Bad experience. You have spoiled my first anniversary. I need my money back."
